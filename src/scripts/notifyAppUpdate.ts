/**
 * Common notify step for both app platforms — shares one script/CLI shape
 * with `publishRelease.ts` (`<platform> ...`) so `publish_release.sh` can
 * call this unconditionally after every publish instead of branching on
 * platform itself.
 *
 * `platform=mobile`: pushes an "update available" notification to every
 * user with a registered FCM token (`User.fcmToken`), cross-organisation —
 * app releases aren't tenant-scoped, so this deliberately isn't org-filtered
 * like `broadcastNotification` (that endpoint is an unrelated org-admin
 * announcement feature, no push, not reused here). Goes through
 * `NotificationService.send()` (type: 'app_update') so each recipient gets
 * both the in-app bell notification AND a real FCM push — the mobile app's
 * `PushNotificationsController` recognizes `data.type === 'app_update'`
 * specifically: if the app is in the foreground it re-checks for an update
 * and shows the dialog immediately (no relaunch needed); if
 * backgrounded/killed, tapping the system notification deep-links straight
 * to the in-app Updates screen.
 *
 * `platform=helper`: a deliberate no-op, not an oversight. Dad-call-recorder
 * (PypeCRM Helper) has no Firebase/FCM integration at all — no token to
 * push to, and no in-app bell UI to show a CRM `Notification` row in even
 * if we created one — so there is nothing this script could actually
 * deliver. Its `UpdateCheckerOverlay` already polls the release manifest on
 * every app open and pops the same update dialog without any push needed;
 * this branch just says so instead of silently doing nothing or (worse)
 * pretending to have notified someone.
 *
 * Run AFTER `publishRelease.ts` has actually published the new version —
 * this only notifies, it doesn't check or change what's published.
 * `publish_release.sh` calls this automatically after every publish; run
 * `notify_app_update.sh <platform> <versionName>` by hand to re-nudge
 * mobile stragglers later without publishing anything new.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npx tsx src/scripts/notifyAppUpdate.ts <platform> <versionName>
 *   <platform> must be "mobile" or "helper"
